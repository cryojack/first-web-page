		<h2>Hi!</h2>
		My name is Mridul Nayar, and I am a BCA student learning how to code and build websites.
		This is my first website which will be uploaded to github on a regular basis. This is only a sample page and will be updated regularly. Below is a little bit more information about me!!
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>What am I studying?</h3>
		I am a 2nd year BCA student. I intend to specialize in web design, specifically in the CSS and Javascript side. I also work as a customer service advisor for Virgin Media at Concentrix.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>My hobbies</h3>
		I like to read, though I haven't read anything new in about 3 years. I love PC games, especially the design part. I have built a new PC just to play the latest games (My PC parts will be updated on this website soon.).
		I also watch a lot of TV shows, like Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld, Game of Thrones, just to name a few.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>Things I'd like to do</h3>
		Learn another language <br />
		Build an operating system <br />
		Skydive once <br />
		Climb Mt. Everest <br />
		Go to Space <br />
		Travel India and the World <br />
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>My Favourite TV shows</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>30 Rock</li>
			<li>Friends</li>
			<li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
			<li>Stranger Things</li>
			<li>Anger Management</li>
			<li>Game Of Thrones</li>
			<li>Gossip Girl</li>
			<li>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</li>
			<li>90210</li>
		</ul>
		...and more
		</p>
		<h3>My education background</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Bishop's School (2007)</li>
			<li>Hume McHenry High School (2009)</li>
			<li>Success Institute (+2 passed in 2015)</li>
			<li>2nd Year BCA from The Madurai Kamraj University</li>
		</ul>
		I understand that there is a gap of 6 years since I joined Hume McHenry and passed my 12th. The reason for that is my academic performance. I didn't pass 12th grade in my first attempt, so I joined the Success Institute of Open Schooling to complete my +2. That took me two years to clear (fall of 2012, since I joined in 2010). But my performance was still quite poor and I didn't pass 12th there either. So I took a year's hiatus and joined the NIIT's GNIIT course (not mentoned here, since I didn't complete it) and studied for that till the year 2014. Then I took another year off in 2015, even though during this 6 year time period, I complted my 12th through open schooling by completing my examinations on-demand. Chemistry was particularly difficult, which is why I couldn't clear it by 2015. Then when the admission card expired, I retook admission, taking over all my previous grades and changed Chemistry to two easy subjects : Data-Entry and Word Processing. I completed my 12th after clearing these subjects and got the certificate in 2015. I joined, as a first year student, the BCA course through the same institute. This is an external course and is being conducted by the Madurai Kamraj university.
