		<p>
		<h2>Hi!</h2>
		My name is Mridul Nayar, and I am a BCA student learning how to code and build websites.
		This is my first website which will be uploaded to github on a regular basis. This is only a sample page and will be updated regularly. Below is a little bit more information about me!!
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>What am I studying?</h3>
		I am a 2nd year BCA student. I intend to specialize in web design, specifically in the CSS and Javascript side. I also work as a customer service advisor for Virgin Media at Concentrix.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h3>My hobbies</h3>
		I like to read, though I haven't read anything new in about 3 years. I love PC games, especially the design part. I have built a new PC just to play the latest games (My PC parts will be updated on this website soon.).
		I also watch a lot of TV shows, like Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld, Game of Thrones, just to name a few.
