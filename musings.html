		<h1><b>Some Random thoughts</b></h1>
		So yesterday I had a dream, which I forgot about soon enough, but it got me thinking <q>Why do dreams happen?</q>.
		Does anyone have any idea as to why dreams happen?
		<br />
		<h3>This might be weird....</h3>
		But I have no knowledge of anything that happened in school.
		<br />
		<h4>What is a computer?</h4>
		Well, I have been thinking about that for a few years now.
		Here are my thoughts :-<br />
		<ul>
			<li>A machine that can think</li>
			<li>An alien invention</li>
			<li>Something you can eat</li>
			<li>What this website is written on</li>
		</ul>
