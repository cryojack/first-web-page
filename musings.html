		Some Random thoughts
		</h1>
		<p>So yesterday I had a dream, which I forgot about soon enough, but it got me thinking <q>Why do dreams happen?</q>.
		Does anyone have any idea as to why dreams happen?</p>
		<br />
		<h3>This might be weird....</h3>
		But I have no knowledge of anything that happened in school.
		<br />
		<h4>What is a computer?</h4>
		Well, I have been thinking about that for a few years now.
		Here are my thoughts :-<br />
		<ul>
			<li>A machine that can think</li>
			<li>An alien invention</li>
			<li>Something you can eat</li>
			<li>What this website is written on</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<h3 style="background-color:wheat;" "color:black;">
			Sometimes I wonder..
		</h3>
		<p style="font-family:courier;">
			If this universe is just a really big RPG simulation in which we are supposed to level up until we die and then start over after checking your friend's score. What do you think?
