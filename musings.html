		<h1><b>Some Random thoughts</b></h1>
		So yesterday I had a dream, which I forgot about soon enough, but it got me thinking <q>Why do dreams happen?</q>.
		Does anyone have any idea as to why dreams happen?
		<br />
		<h3>This might be weird....</h3>
		But I have no knowledge of anything that happened in school
